Want to try the FLIP Fluids addon before buying the [full marketplace product](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/Official-Marketplaces-of-the-FLIP-Fluids-Addon)? Try out the **FLIP Fluids Demo** addon! The FLIP Fluids demo can do almost everything that the full version can and will let you create, run, and render your own fluid simulations with a few small limitations. The demo version is always up-to-date with the latest features and fixes of the full version.

### Limitations

- Simulation meshes are watermarked with _FLIP Fluids Addon_ text
    - Note: the watermark of the demo is baked directly into the simulation meshes. If you install the full version of the addon and load a simulation cache created with the demo version, you will need to re-bake the simulation to remove the watermark.
- The [Mixbox simulated color blending features](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/Mixbox-Installation-and-Uninstallation) are not available in this demo. Color blending features will be limited to basic RGB blending methods.
- Supplementary product content such as [[Example Scenes|Example-Scene-Descriptions]] and [Preset Library Scenes](Preset-Library-Installation-and-Uninstallation) will not be available in the demo.
